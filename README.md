# SSAS Feature Comparison
## Presentation and code from March 6, 2018 to the Charlotte BI Group

This repository contains the presentation and supporting code from the presentation given to the CBIG user group meeting.

The code uses the WideWorldImportersDW sample database available in the Microsoft repository, along with an active directory domain (DEMO.LOCAL) and users.  All databases were built using Visual Studio 2017 and SQL Server 2017.
