# Analysis Services Feature Comparison
## [Charlotte BI Group](http://www.charbigroup.com) - March 6, 2018

This repository contains the presentation and supporting code from the Analysis Services presentation given to the [CBIG](http://www.charbigroup.com) user group meeting in March 2018.  We reviewed the a selected set of scenarios and different approaches to solve the problem on each platform.  The scenarios included Many to Many dimensions, Row Level Security, and Scoping Measure Behavior.

The code uses the WideWorldImportersDW sample database available in the [Microsoft repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples), along with an active directory domain (DEMO.LOCAL) and users.  All databases were built using Visual Studio 2017 and SQL Server 2017.
